Performance is just measured using type counts from batch compilation.

## history.js

Print a CSV of historical Definitely Typed performance.

```
$ node history.js 2019-04-25 2019-05-15
```

## percentileOf.js

Print a report the previous percentile of a package, plus its new percentile.

```
$ node percentileOf.js gulp-jasmine 11715
gulp-jasmine:
Before	Count:	Percentile:
	9111	53.8
After:
	11715	74.8
```

## dependencies.js

Kind of a temp script for finding things that depend on react or aws. I think.
